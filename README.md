## General Information
- We have data of consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the    
  company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision
- Scope is to perform a Exploratory data analysis om the given data 
- and need to find pattern to identify for good customers(who are likely to play the loan) and Defaulters(who are not likely to repay the loan) and lead loss to Finance 
  company

## Conclusions
- 1. If Annual Income is between 25k to 50k then chance of ‘Charged off’ is high whereas chance of ‘Fully Paid’ is high at salary ~14 million (1400000).
- 2. Loan status has strong relationship with grades of customer.  ~94% of Grade A customer has paid the loan (i.e., Loan Status=’Fully Paid’) 
- 3. Applicant who paid less (~ <2000) ‘Last Payment Amount’ are more likely to be Defaulter
- 4. Maximum number of defaulter are those whose verification_status is ‘Source Verified’ and 
Purpose of loan are either ‘small business’, ‘other’ or ‘moving’
